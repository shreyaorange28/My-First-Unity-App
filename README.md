# My-First-Unity-App
I explored level creation on the Unity Runner Game template by following this [tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/publish-your-first-mobile-runner-game#63e9c88eedbc2a297b640566) in order to learn about how to edit 3d game mechanics, how to create and add levels, and how to work with the Unity platform and templates. My goals were just to gain hand-on experience with Unity game development and tools and learn about level development. I do not have further plans to develop this project.
